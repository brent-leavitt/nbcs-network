Permissions - Auxilary Class Psuedo Code for NBCS Network Plugin
Last Updated 4 Oct 2018

  Description: 

  History: 
	This has to do with Patron roles, and represents and existing attempt at a plugin that was called NB_Users, which is suppose to assign role to different users across the network. I think this may be woven into the Roles core class.
